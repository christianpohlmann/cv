## About
Due to the European Union's GDPR (DSGVO in German) it has become difficult for
recruiters to forward CVs of applicants to prospective employers. Ironically,
this made me decide to publish my CV in its entirety.

A rendered pdf file is included in this repository. Alternatively,
you can build the pdf from sources (see below).

Feel free to use the LaTeX sources as template for your own CV.

## Build
In order to build the CV from TeX sources, simply run:
```
pdflatex cv.tex
```

### Requirements
A LaTeX distribution including the "moderncv" package.
